This repo contains some files to support the paper "A Cyber Security Analysis of an Ethernet Train Network", for the public version we will create a full website explaining the research to cyber security academics, rail engineers and the general public. For the review stage we make the following files available:


Train_Traffic.pcap: an example capture from the train communication network

trdpParser.zip: A parser for this traffic written in python

Parsed_Train_Traffic.txt: The parse of the pcap file. 

TrainCaptures: more captures from the train.

TestBed: capture of spoofing the speed on the train test-bed

Photos: pictures of spoofing the speed, the device and ETBN.

JournalPaper.pdf: The draft of a journal paper that has been submitted to an engineering journal. This paper will appear after the conference paper, and cite it will cite the conference paper as previous work.
